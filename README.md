# XTAN

XTAN (Xtreme Trainable Activation Node) is a two component project: 

1. Extensions of [Mila](https://github.com/digantamisra98/Mila) and [β-Mish](https://github.com/digantamisra98/Beta-Mish) activation functions now with β as trainable parameters (named as MilaX and MishX respectively)
2. Layer-wise GridSearch abstract method to obtain best activation function for a layer in a Neural Network Architecture (Under Progress).
